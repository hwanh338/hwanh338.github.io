    <h1>P2: Part 1</h1> <br>
This informative article is on the history of Ambient music history. Ambient music began in <br>
1978 when Brian Eno released his first record. His whole theory was that there should be music <br>
fitting for every situation that is heard but not distracting from what is happening in the <br>
world. The tone was very informative and in my opinion it was very relatable because there are <br>
certain situations like when I am doing homework I do not like to listen to distracting music<br>
for an example I mean rap or anything that is super wordy it distracts me from whatever I am doing. <br>
It also has to fit my mood when I am working out I like to listen to faster music that gets me <br>
motivated whereas when I come home from the gym I am tired and just want to relax I would not <br>
put on the same music I did before I would listen to some calming music that has a slow beat. I <br>
think understanding all this really made me attentive how much the situation and mood I am in really<br>
effects the kind of music I listen to. I think the most important word here is "Ambient". Whenever <br>
I usually think of that word I think of Ambient water its just room temperture. So music that is "room temp"<br>
it fits my mood. The author makes it very intimate with the reader by using personal experince in <br>
his writting. For me as a visual person it really captured me by the way he wrote, and made it a lot <br>
easier. I would think an informative piece of writting would be boring but it was told in kind of a <br>
story telling way which was really nice.<br><br><br>
